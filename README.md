# Civifix

*Civifix* is a web-based civic engagement platform that allows users to report local issues such as potholes, garbage, broken streetlights, waterlogging, and more by uploading photos, writing a brief description, and selecting their location. These reports are shown to nearby users in a story-style format, where they can upvote or downvote to validate the issue. Once verified, the report is forwarded to the appropriate government authority, and their response is shown on the platform.

Civifix also supports government-led movements like *Swachh Bharat Abhiyan* and *Green India Movement*, encouraging users to post photos of their participation using hashtags. This helps promote civic awareness, community involvement, and accountability in a simple and interactiveÂ way.
